## Name
Foodbase

## Description
This web-application is developed for bringing together people with
excess food and people with a need for food.
The application helps reduce food waste and also brings good spirit
to the community.

###Principles
1. Mobile first 
2. User privacy and security (Although security is not top notch currently)
3. Ease of use (intuitive UI)

###Different roles in the application

####Anonymous users can:
    1. Browse the feed
    2. Open posts
    3. Search for posts with keywords and filters

####Registered users can do the same, plus:
    4. Get their feed automatically filtered according to their preferences
    5. Send messages to post authors and chat with them
    6. Flag disturbing posts
    7. Create posts and edit them
    8. Edit their profile and change password (email not editable)
    9. Delete their posts or their account

####Moderators can do the same, plus:
    10.See all flagged posts, the amount of reports per post and the report messages for each post
    11.Delete clearly inappropriate posts that have been reported multiple times
